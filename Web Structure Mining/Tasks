4 tasks on web structure mining are performedon the whole:

1.calculate the degree prestige, proximity prestige and rank
prestige using a graph dataset given in the following link.
http://snap.stanford.edu/data/wiki-Vote.txt.gz

2.write a python program to show the implementation Page Rank algorithm. Update and display the page rank for all the nodes after each
iteration. Count and display the total number of iterations required to meet the
stopping criteria. (stopping criteria:- ε = 0.05, damping factor = 0.9)

3.Write a python program to show the implementation HITS algorithm for the above
graph and display the authority as well as hub score for all the nodes after each
iteration. Count and display the total number of iterations required to meet the
stopping criteria. (stopping criteria:- ε = 0.05 for both hub and authority)

4. Write a python program to calculate the maximum flow in the following graph using
Ford-Fulkerson Max flow algorithm.
